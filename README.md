An archive of alternative keyboard research in 2025 in which I studied leading layouts and built my own.

Ultimately I decided alpha thumb layouts are suboptimal for ergonomic and other biomechanical reasons,
and that the thumb key is much better suited as something more useful like one shot modifier, backspace, enter, etc 

I concluded that something like a graphite/gallium are the best overall layouts as of 2025, but I still think
my specific variant of these layouts is optimal for split keyboards specifically.
