An archive of alternative keyboard research in 2025 in which I studied leading layouts and built my own.

Ultimately I decided alpha thumb layouts are suboptimal for ergonomic and biomechanical reasons (the thumb is slow and clunky)
and that the thumb key is much better suited as a one shot modifier especially for programmers.
